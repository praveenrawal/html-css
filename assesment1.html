    <h2>Django Tutorial : </h2>
    <pre>
    Django is a Python-based web framework that allows you to quickly create efficient web applications.
    When you’re building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user 
    authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way
    to upload files, etc. Django gives you ready-made components to use.
